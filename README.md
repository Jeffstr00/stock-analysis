# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview

We are in charge of assisting Steve, a recent finance graduate, with analyzing green stocks in order to help his parents hopefully make a good investment.  Their current plan is to invest on a single stock solely based on the fact that its ticker symbol coincides with the location of their first date.  In order to see if that is a good idea or not, we looked at two years' worth of data on a dozen different green stocks, which covered thousands of data points.  Since we were dealing with such a large mountain of information, we used Excel and it's Visual Basic editor to run computations for us.
